For this project:
I executed SQL queries on several over 1 million records relational tables using Hive, Pig and Hadoop streaming with MapReduce in AWS.
For scripting MapReduce I used Python and ran it on HDFS to excute queries.
For the second part of the project, I used Python to create a numeric file with 25,000 rows and used Hadoop streaming develop a 
custom version (4 iterations manually using 6 centers) of K-Means clustering.
